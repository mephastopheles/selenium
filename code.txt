To automate the process described in the provided data using Selenium in Python, you can follow the steps outlined in the text, such as opening a browser, performing searches, and interacting with search results. Below is an example of a complete Python script using Selenium to carry out the described operations.

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install Selenium library using pip:
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```
3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and ensure it's in your system PATH.

### Python Script
```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

def main(query):
    # Step 1: Открыть приложение или веб-браузер
    # You can replace 'chrome' with other browsers like 'firefox' if needed.
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()

    try:
        # Step 2: Перейти на страницу поиска Google
        driver.get("https://www.google.com")

        # Step 3: Найти строку поиска
        search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")

        # Step 4: Напечатать текст в строку поиска
        search_box.send_keys(query)

        # Step 5: Запустить поиск
        search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

        # Step 6: Просмотреть результаты поиска
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for results to load

        # Assuming the first result's title and link are of interest
        results = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//h3')
        for index, result in enumerate(results):
            print(f"{index + 1}: {result.text}")

    finally:
        # Close the browser after completing the tasks
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait for a few seconds to review results
        driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input for the search query
    search_query = "найти кота"  # The task's search text
    main(search_query)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports necessary classes from Selenium.
2. **WebDriver Setup**: Initializes the WebDriver for Chrome. You can change this for other browsers as needed.
3. **Visiting Google**: The script opens Google in a browser window.
4. **Finding the Search Box**: Searches for the input box using its name attribute (`"q"`).
5. **Inputting Search Query**: Sends the search query (in this case, "найти кота") to the search box.
6. **Submitting Search**: Simulates pressing the Enter key to execute the search.
7. **Waiting for Results**: Waits for a few seconds to ensure results are loaded.
8. **Extracting and Displaying Results**: Finds elements with the search results and prints their titles to the console.
9. **Closing the Browser**: Ensures the browser is closed after the operations are complete.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure you have the correct WebDriver version that matches your browser version.
- Adjust the sleep times (`time.sleep()`) as needed to ensure elements are fully loaded before interaction.
- This script specifically works with Google; if you need to use another search engine, the URL and element selectors may need to be changed accordingly.
